## **John Wick**
John Wick is a 2014 American neo-noir action thriller film directed by Chad Stahelski (in his feature directorial debut) and written by Derek Kolstad. It stars Keanu Reeves, Michael Nyqvist, Alfie Allen, Adrianne Palicki, Bridget Moynahan, Dean Winters, Ian McShane, John Leguizamo, and Willem Dafoe. It is the first installment in the John Wick film series. The story follows former hitman John Wick and his attempt to hunt down the men who broke into his home, stole his vintage car, and killed his puppy, which was a last gift to him from his recently deceased wife.

**Few reasons to watch John Wick**

1. I love how realistic they made the gun fights. No infinite ammo guns etc. So many movies have lost the art of the reload and recoil.
2. The fact that he ALWAYS makes sure the enemy is dead - head shots all round - as that's what you would expect a master assassin to do.
3. The style/choreography of the fights. So detailed and the effort that went through with them shows on the screen.
4. The story of John Wick is really well built. From the slow beginning to the actual intense action.
5. I just like it :)
